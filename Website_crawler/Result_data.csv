Quickly and easily finding the best spaces to work, meet or have an event means dealing with many unknowns, and a lot of wasted time and effort. Powered by technology and human expertise, BOOQED takes care of everything for you, from searching to booking and payment.

Problem: 
Shift in work culture and pressure for corporates to reduce real-estate costs means a growing need for short-term, flexible options. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for flexibility and cost-savings in workplace options. But finding these spaces is painful and time-consuming. Tenants and landlords lack options to find or monetize unused space. Lack of transparency and hidden costs create trust issues between landlord/tenant. 

Solution: 
The BOOQED platform quickly and easily facilitates transactions between tenants needing short-term space and services and with any unused  or underutilized space. BOOQED reduces rental expense of tenants by providing flexible, short-term space options while increasing revenue for landlords and suppliers by monetizing unused space.

Part of the inaugural Colliers Techstars PropTech accelerator in 2018, BOOQED today has 2,000+ listings on its platform and works with over 50 corporate clients to support their workspace and meeting needs."

It primarily aims at:

- Repositioning guide/traveler matching as the number one criterion for assignment, by eliminating availability from the equation thanks to synchronized calendars;
- Giving tour companies a wider access to a peer-reviewed pool of professional guides;
- Centralizing and facilitating communication between tour companies and their guides;
- Multiplying guides’ revenue streams by increasing their visibility on the market; and
- Becoming the first “TripAdvisor for guides” to track guide performances.

The iZZi ecosystem connects browser-based dashboards (tour companies) with tour guides who have downloaded the iZZi mobile app to their smartphones. Tour companies and guide calendars are automatically synchronized, and algorithms use data from guide profiles (skills, knowledge, expertise, and preferences), along with peer-reviewed ratings, to provide tour companies with the best available guide/client combination. Direct positive impacts on the company workflow are enormous:

Time saving – repetitive tasks are now automatized. Time can be invested in other tasks, including personal meetings with guides and customer service for travelers.

Improved service quality - overall client experience is enhanced, and the tour company gains in reputation.

Increased service consistency - pressure on assignment teams during peak booking season is significantly reduced."

These are the challenges happening in the event industry today:
•	Companies who depended on physical events are struggling to connect with their customers, partners, and staff during the Pandemic
•	Individuals are trying to find ways to celebrate special events with their loved ones
•	Wedding plans are being disrupted
•	Event suppliers are badly hit by the slowdown and economic crisis

How did Onzla help solve this? 
We built an online platform and marketplace to allow Virtual Event Planning. Firstly, we gathered a large group of suppliers who could deliver and support events virtually, integrated them into an intelligent event planning algorithm and launched tools in the platform to allow companies and users to seamlessly connect, greet and send gifts to business associates and loved ones remotely 

With more than 3 million physical events planned in Singapore alone in 2019, we are confident we can replicate most of them virtually using Onzla until the pandemic subsides. And also cater to the massive opportunity in the SEA market with a population of 527 million!

At Onzla, our goals are simple: To ensure that no event should be ever hard to plan, regardless if it’s physical or virtual, every user gets the best deal and their guests show up for the party. We are committed to this dream and mission and will have fun making this happen!

If you would like to be part of this massive opportunity and bring back happiness and memories through events for everyone, connect with Jamie (Founder), Dan (CTO), and the outstanding team to find out how we solve this massive problem during these extremely depressing times!   jamie@onzla.com"

Through a single vendor, grow your regional presence through our physical infrastructure across markets.","Coming from a background in fast-moving consumer goods distribution, we noticed retailers were largely unserviced by the logistics industry. Managing retail inventory with a high number of unique products is challenging. Retail operations that require quick and frequent replenishments need a responsive fulfilment process.

In 2007, the founders established Whitebox – Retail Logistics Specialist – to provide industry-specific services for small and medium-sized retail businesses. The goal was simple – to provide scalable solutions across a spectrum of logistics services to enable retail businesses to mirror backend costs against retail sales & turnover.

The Evolution
Over the years, we uncovered an inherent bottleneck in retail logistics. One of the biggest challenges retailers face today is the lack of inventory visibility. Relying on Stock and Sales reports that are a day old was not good enough anymore. We realised this was costing retailers time, resources, and was highly inefficient.

Since 2010, we began to marry the use of different technologies into our backend systems and retail floor systems to plug this bottleneck – the need for consolidated real-time inventory and order information across all sales touchpoints, and multiple warehouses. But it did not stop there….

The rise of Internet commerce has changed the world. Digital technology has changed the way consumers make purchases. Consumers today do not differentiate between purchasing products from a retail shop, or through the Internet. This has resulted in many new digital sales channels, which inherently increases the complexity of retail logistics to be able to respond to the needs of e-commerce.

Logistics + Technology + Data
Our mantra has evolved since we started operations almost 10 years ago. Today, we see inventory through the eyes of our customers – across all sales touchpoints, online and offline."

The data economy is murky with the data often fragmented and of highly questionable authenticity. This causes major issues for companies and products who rely on data. Despite this major issue, there is an ever-increasing need for data. Nowhere is this more apparent than with mobile location data. 

As the demand for location data increases, there are now regulations to ensure that players in the space do not abuse the data they obtain. Examples of these regulations are the General Data Protection Act in Europe, and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the USA. Data providers that do not meet the requirements set out by these regulations face legal repercussions and must comply. Buyers of location data are also demanding that their providers of data be compliant, or risk losing business. 

Quadrant seeks to bridge this by becoming an industry leading location data provider and providing data buyers with legitimate, authenticated and verifiable location data. Our technologies allows for the mapping of data into verified, compliant, usable, targeted location datasets that de-clutter the field of information for professionals and organisations, allowing them to use inputs relevant to their needs and to analyse them effectively, efficiently, and with confidence.  

By creating an ecosystem that enables access to data that is authentic, traceable and mapped, Quadrant solves data challenges and spurs innovation.

At the technical limitations of dealers’ platform providers, product information is unclear and inadequate. Thus, buyers prefer purchasing used cars offline. Likewise, suppliers are concerned with the problem of slow sales, the buyers’ concern being the culprit. For suppliers, time is money. Additionally we are scaling into other products such as real-estate and video CVs.
Our new software (SAVE - Supervised Automatic Video Editor) will provide a quick and easy way for dealers to move product more efficiently and customers to have access to more accurate and detailed information on the products they want to purchase. We can acquire a lot of suppliers because they can generate content easily through our product. Suppliers shoot videos with a verbal explanation. SAVE then edits and supervises the content with its own algorithm. Buyers watch the video and purchase the product. We’re using Machine Learning, big data, and AI to achieve this. We identify items, check audio, and edit video. This makes the purchasing process more transparent. 
Most current used-car sales platforms only use images and text. The few used car dealers who provide video lack in quality and are manually uploaded to youtube, which is a very slow and costly process.

We help podcasts scale up their shows and monetize using technology.,"Vision: 
Podcast Network Asia’s dream is to make podcasting mainstream in Asia and to be the leading podcast content aggregator and producer. 

Problem:
Podcasting is on the cusp of unprecedented growth but there are common problems that prevent it from realising that potential which are the ff:
1. Podcast Production Standards are not consistent - As more people create podcasts, the audio quality varies which turns listeners and brands off
2. Podcast Monetization - Content creators do not know how to monetize their content
3. Podcast Analytics - Unlike other media, podcasts can be consumed in at least 2 dozen apps which makes the data difficult to aggregate and measure effectively

Product:
We help podcasters solve the problems mentioned above by doing the following:
1. Providing the best shows with world class audio production facilities (studio,equipment) and post-production staff to create great sounding audio
2. We help monetize the podcasts that we support and do a revenue share of 70/30 to 50/50 depending on how involved we are in the show
3. We created our podcast analytics platform called http://podmetrics.co that aggregates all the necessary metrics podcasters and brands care about under one platform

Founders: 
CEO: Ron Baetiong (2x Startup Founder, 1 Exit - ChatbotPH, Podcaster - Hustleshare)
COO: Josef Acuña (Capital Markets Lawyer for IPO, Media Production Expert)
CMO: Eileen Borromeo (Ad Agency Veteran - Former McCann Director, Head Southeast Asia Marketing - Payoneer)

Early Hires: 
Head Producer: Ryan Cardenas (Radio DJ, Former Station Manager)
Head of Sales: Ellen Concepcion (ChatbotPH Top Seller)

Market: TAM: $300M in Southeast Asia with projections that market will be as big as the US in 5 years. 18% YOY growth in podcast consumption in Asia.

Business:  Since Sept 2019 we’ve made 35+ podcasts produced with 3.5 Million listeners combined and $50,000 in revenue"

In effect, it helps small retailers become more than just general traders. Using PriyoShop’s retailer-facing app, a small retailer can offer his customers a wide range of products including mobile phone, electronics, gadgets, and lifestyle products for customers, make bill payments and assist e-commerce shoppers. The company plans to offer more such services, including top-up, DTH Bill payment, utility bill,  travel booking, bus ticketing, and air tickets going forward. Besides, the firm’s app connects the retailer directly with consumer brands, helping in direct sourcing of products and involves itself in last-mile fulfillment as well.
E-commerce, as it stands today, is only less than 1% of the total retail sector. Large format retail has become stagnant, about 2% of the entire segment, which leaves us with about 97% of the market. Even in 2021, it will still be about 85-87%. That’s the large elephant in the room waiting to be addressed. Instead of fighting with other digital commerce in the red ocean market, we decided to partner with the small retailers and make them the hub of digital commerce. Currently, we have more than 10,000 agents on our platform across 490 towns and generating $200,000 GMV in every month with month-to-month double digits growth. But there is room for more. We generate on average 20% margin and share a certain percentage with retail agents. The profitability number of PriyoShop is 60–80 percent higher, better than traditional digital commerce. The startup has more than 1000 brands in its portfolio, including Samsung, Unilever Bangladesh, P&G, ACI Toiletries, Nokia, Apple, Asus Bangladesh and many more. With a team of 100 members, it aims to reach more than 50,000 retailers by 2021. We believe this will become a unicorn business opportunity in 3-4 years by partnering with MSME"

Most of waste are mixed pick-up, only 9% of waste get segregated. The first pillar aims to solve the issues by increasing waste segregation and recycling rate, via two main products:

- Rekosistem Apps
The Apps is consist of Apps for user and for Waste Picker. Users will get reward by sell their segregated waste and report it through Apps. The report will notify Waste Pickers in the area who already partnered with Rekosistem. Waste Pickers will do their job as usual, pick-up waste from users' bin. During pick-up process, waste pickers will validate whether the waste already segregated as per reported or not. Once valid, users will get reward.

-IoT Smart Drop Box
This product is a smart bin for plastic products packaging. Users can drop certain classified plastic waste into the Drop Box. The drop box will directly reward digital money per waste dropped. 

2. Renergi - IoT Anaerobic Digestion Method
The second pillar aim to increase renewable energy production. Organic waste is the biggest waste type in Indonesia, contributes into 60% of total waste. The solution is bio-digester for community and industry that convert organic waste into energy and bio-fertilizer.

Currently, organic waste is an invaluable waste in the existing chain. Through Renergi, the organic waste will be valued. Every 100 kg organic waste can produced 24 KW or 100 hours biogas as renewable energy."

The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. This","Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.

The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale."
